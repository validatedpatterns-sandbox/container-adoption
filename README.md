## Start Here

This is a community pattern based on the Validated Pattern framework.  The Container Adoption Journey community pattern
uses the Validated Pattern framework to deploy resources onto a OpenShift cluster and uses the openshift-gitops
operator to deploy these resources.  

This is the first version of the Container Adoption Journey community pattern that can be used by consultants in
a Container Adoption Journey engagement.
